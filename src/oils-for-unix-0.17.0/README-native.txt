Oils for Unix
=============

This is a preview of Oil's translation to C++.

To use it, run

    ./configure     # detects whether GNU readline is installed, etc.

    _build/oils.sh  # builds optimized binary

    sudo ./install
    
All you need is a C++ compiler.

Then try:

    osh -c 'echo hi'    

    osh -n -c 'echo hi'  # parse a script
