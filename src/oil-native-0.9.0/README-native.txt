oil-native
==========

This preview release contains a shell PARSER in C++, not a working shell!

Visit http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html and download
oil-$VERSION.tar.{gz,xz} to get a working Oil shell.

To try oil-native, run:

    build/mycpp.sh tarball-demo
    
All you need is a C++ compiler.

It will compile the code and parse a shell snippet with it.  It will show you
how to parse other files.
